This MATLAB project focuses on removing noise from both sinusoidal signals and real-world audio recordings by implementing filtering techniques to enhance signal quality. It generates and adds noise to a pure sinusoidal signal, processes real-world audio recordings with noise, and applies filtering methods such as low-pass, high-pass, and adaptive filters to improve clarity. The project allows users to compare the original, noisy, and filtered signals for analysis. To run the project, MATLAB  and the Signal Processing Toolbox (if advanced filtering methods are used) are required. Users can execute noise_removal.m to choose between processing a synthetic sinusoid or a real-world audio file, visualize time-domain and frequency-domain analysis, and listen to the cleaned audio for evaluation. The output includes graphical comparisons and audio playback of the original, noisy, and filtered signals, demonstrating the effectiveness of the noise removal techniques.
